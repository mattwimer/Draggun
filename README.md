# Premise
You are a soldier in stationed at a remote headquarters (HQ) on a new planet. There are hostile aliens of all shapes and sizes which approach your base. To defend yourself and your HQ, you are given an experimental new weapon called a "Draggun".
# Gameplay
Your HQ is stationed at the center of the screen and you use your weapon by clicking and dragging with your mouse to create a targeting box. When you release your mouse, devastation occurs and ANYTHING inside is decimated. It is your job to survive the alien onslaught without your base being badly damaged (by you or the world's inhabitants).
